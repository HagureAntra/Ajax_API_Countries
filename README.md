# Ajax_API_Countries

First Ajax project where I used this link: https://restcountries.com/ to pull all the data from. 

Those small icon images are html code actually-there is a Microsoft Word file added that includes links I used to find specific emojies. 
It is possible to convert UTF-8 unicode emoji into &# Html code. Goggle UTF to HTMl emoji converter and it will come up-there are several websites that convert them.

All the classes added to html code that are pasted in JavaScript file can be used for CSS. 

If you wonder how I aligned cards side by side, it was goood old "float-left" property. 

Setting responsivness on the most popular devices,was a pain to me-Samsung Galaxy Fold (280px 653 px), Surface Duo (540px 720px).
Media querries took me a long time because portrait and landscape positions have different screen sizing. I changed the header background and text color to understand which screen and position i have done and, which one needs a separate querry.

I am planning to do more small Ajax projects - API called when button is clicked, form is submitted and auto image generator.

Even though there are other, faster ways to fetch API (rapidAPI, Fetchapi, Axios), I find Ajax syntax easy to understand and work with.
